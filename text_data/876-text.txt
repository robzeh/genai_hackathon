Agent 2: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling scared. Don't worry, we're here to help you. Can you please tell me what symptoms you're experiencing?

Customer: I've been having a high fever for the past two days, and I feel extremely weak and fatigued. I also have a persistent cough and difficulty breathing.

Agent 2: I understand how concerning those symptoms can be. Given the current situation, it's important to take precautions. Have you traveled recently or been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19?

Customer: No, I haven't traveled anywhere, and I don't know anyone who has tested positive. But I'm still worried.

Agent 2: I completely understand your concerns. It's always better to be cautious. Given your symptoms, I would recommend seeking medical attention. Have you considered going to the nearest hospital or clinic?

Customer: I'm scared to go to the hospital because I don't want to be exposed to more germs. Is there any alternative?

Agent 2: I understand your concern, but hospitals have strict protocols in place to minimize the risk of exposure. However, if you prefer an alternative, you can consider scheduling a telehealth appointment with one of our doctors. They can assess your symptoms and provide guidance remotely.
