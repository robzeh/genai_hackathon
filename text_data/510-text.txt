Agent 3: Sarah, I have reviewed your insurance coverage and your bill. It seems that some services were not fully covered by your insurance, resulting in the higher bill. However, you are eligible for a payment plan to make it more manageable for you. Would you like to discuss the payment options?

Customer: Yes, please. I would appreciate any help I can get.

Agent 3: Of course, Sarah. We have various payment options available. We can set up a monthly installment plan based on your financial situation. This will allow you to pay off the balance over a period of time. Additionally, we can also assist you in exploring any financial assistance programs that you may qualify for. Would you like more information on these options?

Customer: Yes, please. I'm not sure what financial assistance programs are available to me.

Agent 3: Not a problem, Sarah. We have a dedicated financial assistance team who can guide you through the process and assess your eligibility for any available programs. They will work closely with you to understand your financial situation and find the best solution. Would it be okay if I transfer your call to them?

Customer: Yes, that would be great. Thank you for your help, Agent 3.

Agent 3: You're welcome, Sarah. I'm glad I could assist you. Let me transfer your call to our financial assistance team. Please stay on the line, and they will be able to provide you with more information and assistance. Is there anything else I can help you with?
