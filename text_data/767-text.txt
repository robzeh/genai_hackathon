Nurse: Hello, this is Nurse Lisa from HealthHarbor's care management team. I understand you're experiencing some discomfort after your surgery, Sarah. Can you please provide me with some more details about your symptoms?

Customer: Hi, Nurse Lisa. The pain is a dull ache in the incision area, and it feels slightly tender to touch. I've been taking the prescribed pain medication, but it doesn't seem to be providing much relief.

Nurse: Thank you for sharing that information, Sarah. It's good that you've been taking the prescribed medication. Based on what you've described, it's possible that you may be experiencing normal post-operative pain. However, to be on the safe side, I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment with your surgeon. They can examine the incision area and provide you with a more accurate assessment.

Customer: I see. Should I be concerned that something might be wrong?

Nurse: It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to post-operative care, Sarah. While it's likely nothing serious, it's important for your surgeon to evaluate your condition and address any concerns you may have. They may also be able to provide you with alternative pain management options if necessary.

Customer: Alright, I understand. I will contact my surgeon's office to schedule a follow-up appointment. Thank you for your advice, Nurse Lisa.

Nurse: You're welcome, Sarah. I'm glad I could help. If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to support you throughout your recovery process.

Customer: Thank you, Nurse Lisa. I appreciate your assistance. Have a great day.

Nurse: You too, Sarah. Take care and have a speedy recovery.
