Customer: Yes, I have been referred to Dr. Anderson, a gastroenterologist. I believe I need to schedule an appointment with him.

Agent 2: That's convenient. Let me check Dr. Anderson's availability. It seems like he has some availability next week. How about Tuesday at 10:00 AM? Does that work for you?

Customer: Tuesday at 10:00 AM works for me. Please go ahead and schedule the appointment.
