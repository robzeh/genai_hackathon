Customer: Yes, my date of birth is May 15, 1985. I was treated at your hospital for a surgery last year.

Agent 1: Thank you for providing that information, Sarah. I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling scared. I assure you that we'll handle your request with utmost care and confidentiality. Could you please let me know the reason for requesting your medical records?

Customer: Well, I recently changed doctors, and they have requested my previous medical records for continuity of care. I'm just scared because I want to ensure that all the necessary information is transferred accurately.

Agent 1: I completely understand your concern, Sarah. Rest assured, we have a strict process in place to ensure the accuracy and privacy of your records. Let me go ahead and initiate the request for you. Can you please confirm your contact information so that we can reach out to you if there are any questions or updates regarding your request?

Customer: Yes, my phone number is 555-1234 and my email address is sarahjohnson@email.com.

Agent 1: Thank you, Sarah. I have noted down your contact information. Now, let's discuss the specifics of your medical records request. Do you need your complete medical history or just specific documents?

Customer: I think I would like to request my complete medical history, just to be thorough.

Agent 1: Perfect, Sarah. I'll make sure to include all the necessary documents in your request. Just to confirm, would you like us to send the records directly to your new doctor's office, or would you prefer to pick them up in person?

Customer: I would prefer if you could send them directly to my new doctor's office. It would be more convenient for me.

Agent 1: That's a great question, Sarah. There may be a nominal fee associated with processing your medical records request. However, I recommend checking with your new doctor's office, as they may cover the cost as part of their services. They can also guide you on any potential insurance coverage.
