Agent 2: I apologize for the wait, Emily. It seems that your prescription is due for a refill. I will send a request to your primary care physician right away. They will review and approve the refill. Once approved, you will be able to pick up your medication at your preferred pharmacy. Is there anything else I can assist you with regarding your refill?

Agent 2: I'm sorry to hear that, Emily. Drowsiness and nausea are known side effects of Zoloft, but it's important to consult with your healthcare provider about any concerns you may have. They will be able to evaluate your situation and suggest any necessary adjustments to your medication. Would you like me to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician?

Customer: Yes, please. I would appreciate that.

Agent 2: Noted, Emily. I will request an appointment for you. You should receive a call from your primary care physician's office soon to schedule the appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, that's all for now. Thank you for your help, Agent 2. I really appreciate it.

Agent 2: You're welcome, Emily. I'm glad I could assist you. If you have any more questions or concerns in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care and have a great day!
