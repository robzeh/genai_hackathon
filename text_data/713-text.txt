Customer: Actually, I have a question about the medical records fee. Will there be any charges for this request?

Agent 3: That's a great question, Emily. HealthHarbor does charge a nominal fee for medical records requests to cover administrative costs. However, the exact fee will depend on the number of pages and any additional services requested. Once we receive your form, our team will review your request and inform you of the fee before proceeding. Rest assured, we strive to keep the fees as reasonable as possible.

Customer: I understand. Thank you for clarifying that. I have one more question. Can you provide me with an estimate of how many pages my medical records might have?

Agent 3: I apologize, Emily, but I don't have immediate access to that information. The number of pages can vary depending on your medical history and the duration of your visits. However, our team will provide you with the exact number once they process your request. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

Customer: No, that's all. Thank you for your help, Agent 3. I appreciate your assistance.

Agent 3: You're welcome, Emily. It was my pleasure assisting you today. If you have any other questions in the future, feel free to contact us. Have a great day!
