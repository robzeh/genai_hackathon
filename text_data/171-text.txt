(Agent 1 consults with the medical team)

Agent 1: Thank you for your patience, Emily. Dizziness and lightheadedness are potential side effects of your blood pressure medication. However, it's important to ensure that the dosage and usage of the medication are appropriate for you. I recommend scheduling an appointment with your primary care physician to discuss these symptoms further. They might need to adjust your dosage or switch you to a different medication.
