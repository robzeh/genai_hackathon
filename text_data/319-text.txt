Agent 3: I understand, Emma. I'm here to help. Can you please provide me with some more details about the lab and test results you received?

Customer: Sure. I had a blood test done last week, and my doctor informed me that there were some abnormalities in the results. She mentioned something about my liver enzymes being elevated.

Agent 3: I see, Emma. I can imagine how concerning that must be for you. Let me check your records to get a better understanding of the situation. Could you please provide me with your date of birth?
