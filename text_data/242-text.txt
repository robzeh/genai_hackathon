Agent 2: Thank you for calling HealthHarbor, my name is Agent 2. How can I assist you today?

Customer: Hi Agent 2, my name is Jessica Smith. I recently had a procedure at your hospital and I have some questions regarding my follow-up care.

Agent 2: Hello Jessica, I'm here to help. Could you please provide me with your patient ID or any other identification details so I can access your medical records?

Customer: Sure, my patient ID is 123456789.

Agent 2: Thank you, Jessica. How can I assist you with your follow-up care?

Customer: I had a surgery last week and I'm experiencing some pain and discomfort at the incision site. I'm not sure if this is normal or if I should be concerned.

Agent 2: I understand your concerns, Jessica. Pain and discomfort after surgery can be expected, but it's important to monitor it closely. Have you been following the post-operative care instructions provided by your surgeon?

Agent 2: I'm glad you reached out. It's always better to be safe than sorry. Let me check your records and consult with a healthcare professional to provide you with accurate information. Please hold on for a moment.
