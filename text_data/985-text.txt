(Customer waits for a brief moment)

Agent 1: I have reviewed your bill, John. It seems that there was an error in the billing. You were charged for a procedure that should have been covered by your insurance. I apologize for the inconvenience.

Customer: Oh, I see. Thank you for catching that. What should I do next to resolve this issue?

Agent 1: I will escalate this issue to our billing department, John. They will review your case and make the necessary adjustments. You should receive an updated bill reflecting the correct charges within the next billing cycle.
