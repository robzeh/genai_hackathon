Customer: Hi Agent 2, my name is Sarah Johnson. I recently had some lab and test done at your hospital and I was wondering if the results are available?

Customer: Sure, my date of birth is January 15, 1985, and I had a blood test and an MRI done last week.

Agent 2: Thank you for providing that information, Ms. Johnson. Let me check your records to see if the results are available. Please bear with me for a moment.
