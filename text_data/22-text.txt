Agent 4: Thank you for calling HealthHarbor, my name is Agent 4. How can I assist you today?

Customer: Finally, someone answers! I have been waiting for my lab and test results for over a week now. This is unacceptable!

Agent 4: I apologize for the delay in receiving your results. I understand your frustration. May I have your name and date of birth, please?

Customer: My name is Jane Smith, and my date of birth is January 15, 1985. Can you please tell me why it's taking so long for me to get my results?

Agent 4: I'm sorry, Ms. Smith. Let me check your records. I see here that your results were sent to the lab for processing on January 7th. It usually takes about 3-5 business days to receive the results. Let me check with the lab to see what the delay is.
