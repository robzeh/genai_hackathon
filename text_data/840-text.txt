Agent 1: Thank you, Lisa. I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling unwell. Can you please describe your symptoms to me?

Customer: I've been having a high fever, severe headache, and body aches. I'm also experiencing a sore throat and a cough.

Agent 1: I'm not a doctor, but those symptoms could be indicative of a viral infection, possibly the flu. It's important to see a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis. Have you visited a doctor yet?

Customer: No, I haven't. I was hoping to get some advice from you before making an appointment.

Customer: Well, how long does the flu usually last? I can't afford to take too much time off work.

Agent 1: The duration of the flu can vary from person to person, but typically it lasts for about a week to ten days. However, it's important to note that complications can arise, especially if left untreated. I strongly recommend seeing a doctor as soon as possible to prevent any further complications.

Customer: Ugh, this is so frustrating. I can't believe I have to deal with this.
