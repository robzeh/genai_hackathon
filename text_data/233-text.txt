Agent 1: Thank you for calling HealthHarbor, my name is Agent 1. How can I assist you today?

Customer: Hi, Agent 1. My name is Sarah Thompson. I have some concerns regarding my insurance and billing. I'm really worried about it.

Agent 1: Hello, Sarah. I understand your worry. Don't worry, I'm here to help you. Could you please provide me with your account or policy number so that I can access your information?

Customer: Sure, it's 123456789.

Agent 1: Thank you, Sarah. Let me pull up your information. I see here that you recently had a hospital visit. How can I assist you with your insurance and billing inquiries?

Customer: Well, I received my insurance statement, and it seems that some of the charges are not covered. I'm not sure why that is.

Agent 1: I understand your concern, Sarah. Let me review your billing details. It appears that certain services you received may not be covered under your insurance plan. I can explain the charges in detail and help you understand why they are not covered.

Customer: That would be great. I just want to understand why I have to pay for these services out of pocket.

Agent 1: I completely understand, Sarah. Let me break it down for you. It seems that the services in question fall under your insurance plan's non-covered services category. This means that they are not included in your plan's benefits, and you are responsible for the payment.

Customer: Oh, I see. But I wasn't aware of these non-covered services. Is there any way to avoid such surprises in the future?

Agent 1: Absolutely, Sarah. To avoid any surprises, I recommend reviewing your insurance policy documents or contacting your insurance provider directly to understand the coverage details and any limitations. Additionally, our hospital provides a pre-authorization service where you can check if a particular service is covered by your insurance before receiving it.

Customer: That's helpful advice. I'll make sure to check my policy and utilize the pre-authorization service next time. Thank you for the information. Is there anything else I need to know about my billing?

Agent 1: You're welcome, Sarah. I'm glad I could assist you. Regarding your billing, it appears that the remaining balance after insurance coverage is due. If you need assistance with setting up a payment plan or have any concerns about the amount due, I can connect you with our billing department for further assistance.

Customer: Yes, please. I would appreciate that. I want to ensure that I can manage the payment comfortably.

Agent 1: Of course, Sarah. I will transfer you to our billing department. Please hold for a moment.
