(Customer and Agent 4 on hold for a short period)

Agent 4: Emily, I have checked our system, and I can confirm that we have your medical records from January 2018 to December 2020. However, there is a standard procedure we need to follow for releasing medical records. I will guide you through the process.

Customer: Alright, please let me know what I need to do.

Agent 4: First, you will need to fill out a Medical Records Request Form. You can find this form on our hospital's website under the "Patient Resources" section. Once you have completed the form, you can either submit it online or print it out and send it to our Medical Records Department via mail or fax.

Customer: Okay, I will go to the website and fill out the form. Can you please provide me with the mailing address and fax number?

Customer: I understand. Is there any fee associated with this request?

Agent 4: Yes, Emily. There is a standard fee for releasing medical records. The fee covers the costs of processing, copying, and mailing the records. The exact amount will depend on the number of pages in your medical records. However, I can assure you that it will be within the guidelines set by the state.

Customer: Alright, I appreciate the information. Is there any way to expedite the process?

Agent 4: In certain cases, we do offer expedited services for an additional fee. If you have an urgent need for your medical records, I recommend discussing this with our Medical Records Department when you submit your request form. They will be able to provide you with more information and options.

Customer: Thank you for letting me know. I will consider that if needed. Is there anything else I should be aware of regarding my medical records request?

Agent 4: One important thing to note, Emily, is that your medical records will be released in accordance with HIPAA regulations. This means that certain sensitive information, such as psychiatric or HIV-related records, may require additional authorization. Our Medical Records Department will reach out to you if any additional steps are necessary.

Customer: Understood, Agent 4. I appreciate your assistance and the clarification. I will fill out the form and submit it as soon as possible. Thank you for your help.
