Agent 2: You're welcome, Emily. Now, please fill out the consent form accurately and sign it. Once that's done, you can either scan and email it back to us or mail it to our address, whichever is more convenient for you.

Customer: I'll fill it out right away and email it back to you. Do I need to include any additional information or documents?

Agent 2: Just make sure to include a copy of your photo ID along with the completed consent form. That will help us verify your identity and process your request promptly.

Customer: Understood. I will include a copy of my photo ID as well. Is there any fee associated with this request?
