Agent 2: I completely understand, Sarah. I'll make a note of your request, and a care manager will be in touch with you shortly. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: Actually, there is one more thing. I received a bill from the hospital, and I'm not sure if it's accurate. Can you help me with that?

Agent 2: Of course, Sarah. I can assist you with billing inquiries as well. Can you please provide me with the details of the bill, such as the amount and any specific services mentioned?
