Agent 4: Thank you for calling HealthHarbor. This is Agent 4. How can I assist you today?

Customer: Hi, Agent 4. I'm really scared and not feeling well. I was hoping you could help me with some medical advice or symptom assessment.

Agent 4: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling scared. I'm here to help you. Can you please tell me what symptoms you're experiencing?

Customer: I've been having a persistent headache for the past two days. It's a throbbing pain on one side of my head, and it's getting worse.

Agent 4: I understand your concern. Headaches can be quite uncomfortable. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?

Customer: Yes, I've also been feeling nauseous and sensitive to light. I've been having difficulty concentrating as well.

Agent 4: These symptoms sound concerning. It's important to note that I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general guidance.
