Agent 3: Yes, Emily. We have a dedicated cardiology department with highly skilled cardiologists who can help diagnose and treat various heart conditions. They can perform tests such as EKGs, stress tests, and echocardiograms to assess your heart health. Would you like me to schedule an appointment for you?

Customer: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. I'm also concerned about the cost of these services. Do you accept insurance?

Agent 3: Of course, Emily. We work with most major insurance providers, and we can assist you in verifying your coverage. If you have insurance, we will bill your provider directly.
