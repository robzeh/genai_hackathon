Agent 2: Thank you for calling HealthHarbor, my name is Agent 2. How can I assist you today?

Customer: Hi Agent 2, my name is John Smith. I recently had a procedure done at your hospital and I have a few questions regarding my follow-up care.

Agent 2: Hello, Mr. Smith. I'd be happy to help you with any questions you may have. Could you please provide me with your patient ID or date of birth for verification?

Customer: Sure, my date of birth is January 15th, 1980.

Agent 2: Thank you, Mr. Smith. How can I assist you with your follow-up care?

Customer: I had surgery last week, and I'm not quite sure about my post-operative care instructions. Could you please clarify what I need to do?

Agent 2: Of course, Mr. Smith. Let me pull up your records. It seems like you had a minor procedure. For the first few days, it's essential to keep the incision site clean and dry. You should also avoid any strenuous activities or heavy lifting. Did your surgeon provide you with any specific instructions?

Customer: Yes, they did mention the incision site and avoiding heavy lifting. But I'm not clear on how long I should continue these precautions.

Agent 2: Typically, it's advised to follow these precautions for at least two weeks after the surgery. However, it's crucial to consult with your surgeon to get personalized instructions based on your specific case. Would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment for you?

Customer: Yes, that would be great. I'm not sure when I should come in for the follow-up. Can you help me with that?

Agent 2: Absolutely, Mr. Smith. Let me check the available dates with your surgeon. Can you please hold for a moment?

Customer: Sure, take your time.

Agent 2: Thank you for your patience, Mr. Smith. I have scheduled your follow-up appointment for next Monday at 2 PM. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yes, that works well for me. Thank you for scheduling it. Is there anything else I should be aware of regarding my follow-up care?

Agent 2: It's essential to continue taking any prescribed medications as directed by your surgeon. If you experience any unusual symptoms or have concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to our hospital's helpline. We're available 24/7 to assist you.
