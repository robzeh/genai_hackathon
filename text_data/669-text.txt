Care Management: Hello, this is Care Management. How can I assist you today?

Customer: Hi, I'm Emily Johnson. I recently had a procedure done at HealthHarbor, and I've been experiencing a lot of pain and discomfort. I'm not sure if this is normal or if there's something wrong.

Care Management: I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this, Emily. Let me pull up your medical records and see if I can provide some guidance. Can you please describe the type of pain and discomfort you're experiencing?

Customer: It's a sharp pain around the incision area, and it's also quite tender to touch. Additionally, I've been having difficulty sleeping due to the discomfort.

Care Management: Thank you for sharing that information, Emily. Based on what you've described, it's possible that you may be experiencing some normal post-procedure pain. However, I will schedule an appointment for you to see your healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation. In the meantime, I can provide you with some tips to manage the pain and discomfort. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, please. I would appreciate any advice you can give me to alleviate the pain.

Care Management: First, it's important to keep the incision clean and dry. You can use mild soap and water to gently clean the area. Applying an ice pack wrapped in a cloth for 10-15 minutes at a time can also help reduce swelling and numb the area. Additionally, taking over-the-counter pain medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen as directed can provide relief. However, it's crucial to follow your healthcare provider's instructions and not exceed the recommended dosage.

Customer: Thank you for the recommendations. I will definitely try them out. I appreciate your help and guidance.

Care Management: You're welcome, Emily. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

Customer: No, that's all for now. I feel much better knowing what steps I can take to manage the pain. Thank you again for your help.

Care Management: I'm glad I could assist you, Emily. If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us. Take care and have a speedy recovery!

Customer: Thank you, I will. Goodbye.

Care Management: Goodbye, Emily. Take care. [/INST] Follow-up Calls and Care Management </s>
