Customer: Thank you, Agent 3. My date of birth is November 15, 1985. I have been a patient at HealthHarbor for the past five years.

Agent 3: Great, thank you for confirming, Sarah. Now, could you please specify the specific medical records you would like to request? It would be helpful if you could provide the approximate dates or any specific departments you visited during your time at HealthHarbor.

Customer: I'm mostly interested in obtaining my records related to my recent surgery. I had a knee replacement surgery on June 25, 2021. I believe that should be the most relevant information.

Agent 3: Thank you for your patience, Sarah. I have checked with our medical records department, and they have informed me that we have a specific form for requesting medical records. I will be happy to assist you with filling out the form and guiding you through the process.

Customer: That would be great, Agent 3. I appreciate your assistance.

Agent 3: Not a problem, Sarah. Before we proceed, I want to inform you that there might be a fee associated with obtaining your medical records. The exact amount will depend on the number of pages and the format you prefer. Is that okay with you?

Customer: Yes, I understand. Please proceed.

Agent 3: Alright, Sarah. Firstly, I will need your consent to release your medical records. Once we have your consent, I will email you the necessary form. You can fill it out and return it to us via email or fax. Does that work for you?
