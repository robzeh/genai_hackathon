Agent 3: Thank you for waiting, Emily. I have the results of your blood test here. Overall, everything seems to be within the normal range. However, there are a few values that are slightly elevated. Would you like me to go through them in detail?

Customer: Yes, please. I'd like to know more about the elevated values.

Agent 3: Alright, let's go through them one by one. Your cholesterol levels are slightly higher than the recommended range.
