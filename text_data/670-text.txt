Agent 4: Thank you for calling HealthHarbor, my name is Agent 4. How can I assist you today?

Customer: Hi, Agent 4. My name is Emily Johnson. I'm feeling really scared and I need some help with my medical records.

Agent 4: Hi, Emily. I'm here to help you. I understand that you're feeling scared. Don't worry, we'll sort this out. Can you please provide me with your date of birth and address for verification?

Customer: Sure, my date of birth is September 15, 1985, and my address is 123 Maple Street.

Agent 4: Thank you for providing that information, Emily. Now, could you please let me know what specific medical records you're looking to request?

Customer: I need the records from my recent hospital stay. I was admitted last month for a surgery and I want to have a copy of all the documents related to my treatment.

Agent 4: I understand how important it is for you to have access to your medical records, Emily. Let me check our system to see if we can provide you with those records. Please bear with me for a moment.

Customer: Thank you, Agent 4. I really appreciate your help.

Agent 4: Emily, I have good news. We do have your medical records from your recent hospital stay. However, we need your consent to release them to you. I can either send them to you via mail or email, or you can come to our hospital and pick them up in person. Which option would you prefer?

Customer: Oh, I'd rather have them sent to me via email. It would be more convenient for me.
