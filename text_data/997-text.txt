Customer: Thank you for the advice, Agent 4. I'll definitely try those suggestions. Is there anything else I should be aware of?

Agent 4: It's always important to monitor your symptoms and seek immediate medical attention if they worsen or if you experience any new, severe symptoms. It's better to be safe and have a professional evaluate your condition.

Customer: I understand. I'll keep an eye on things and schedule an appointment with my doctor soon. Thank you for your help, Agent 4.
