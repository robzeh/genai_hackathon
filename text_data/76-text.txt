Agent 3: Thank you for calling HealthHarbor, my name is Agent 3. How can I assist you today?

Agent 3: Of course, I'd be happy to assist you. I'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling well. Could you please provide me with your name and some basic information so I can access your records?

Customer: My name is John Smith. I have been a patient at HealthHarbor for a few years now.

Agent 3: Thank you, John. I have your records here. I see that you have been referred to a specialist in the past. Could you let me know which specialist you would like to see this time?

Customer: I'm not sure which specialist I need to see. I've been having some digestion issues, so I think I may need to see a gastroenterologist.
