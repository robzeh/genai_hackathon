Agent: Thank you for providing the details, Ms. Johnson. To process your medical records request, I will need your written authorization. Would you like me to email or mail the authorization form to you?

Customer: Email would be more convenient for me. Could you please send it to sarahjohnson@example.com?

Customer: Okay, I'll keep an eye on my inbox. Once I send the form back, how long will it take for me to receive my medical records?

Agent: Once we receive your completed authorization form, it typically takes around 5-7 business days to process your request. However, please note that due to high demand, there might be a slight delay. We will do our best to provide you with your records as soon as possible.

Customer: That sounds reasonable. I appreciate your help. Can I also request a copy of my lab test results from those visits?

Agent: Of course, Ms. Johnson. You can indicate your request for lab test results on the authorization form. If there are specific tests you need, please mention them, and we will do our best to include them in your records.

Customer: Great, I will make sure to specify that on the form. Are there any fees associated with obtaining my medical records?

Agent: Yes, there may be a fee for processing your medical records request. However, it depends on the size and complexity of your records. Once we receive your completed authorization form, our medical records department will assess the cost and inform you accordingly.

Customer: I see. I hope the fee is reasonable. Is there any way to get an estimate of the cost beforehand?

Agent: I understand your concern, Ms. Johnson. While I don't have access to the exact cost, I recommend reaching out to our medical records department directly after sending the form. They will be able to provide you with an estimate and address any further questions you may have.
