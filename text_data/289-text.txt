Pharmacist: Hello, this is Pharmacist Jane. How can I assist you today?

Customer: Hi, Pharmacist Jane. I'm Sarah, and I recently started taking a new allergy medication. I'm experiencing some side effects and was wondering if you could provide me with more information.

Customer: The medication is called Zyrtec, and I've been experiencing drowsiness and dry mouth.

Pharmacist: Thank you for providing that information, Sarah. Drowsiness and dry mouth are common side effects of Zyrtec.

In the meantime, make sure to stay hydrated and avoid activities that require alertness if you feel excessively drowsy.

Customer: Thank you, Pharmacist Jane. I will follow your advice and reach out to my doctor if the side effects worsen. Is there anything else I should be aware of?

Pharmacist: You're welcome, Sarah. Just be aware that Zyrtec may interact with certain medications or medical conditions. It's always best to consult with your doctor or pharmacist before starting any new medication. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us anytime.

Customer: I will definitely keep that in mind. Thank you, Pharmacist Jane. I appreciate your help.

Pharmacist: You're welcome, Sarah. Take care, and I hope your side effects improve soon. Have a great day!
