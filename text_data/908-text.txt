Customer: Yes, my patient ID is 1234567.

Agent 1: Thank you, Emily. Let me pull up your file. While I do that, could you please let me know which specific test results you are concerned about?

Customer: I had a comprehensive blood test done, and I'm particularly worried about my cholesterol levels. They have been high in the past, and I want to know if they have improved.
