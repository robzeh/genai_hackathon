Agent 3: Emma, I have checked the details of your Metformin prescription. It is important to take this medication with meals to minimize the risk of stomach upset. Additionally, it is advisable to avoid alcohol while taking Metformin as it can increase the chance of experiencing lactic acidosis.

Customer: Got it. I will keep an eye on my blood sugar levels and inform my doctor if anything changes. Thank you for your help, Agent 3.
