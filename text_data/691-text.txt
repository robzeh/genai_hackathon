Agent 2: Thank you for calling HealthHarbor. My name is Agent 2. How can I assist you today?

Customer: Hi, Agent 2. My name is Emily Johnson. I've been feeling really worried about some symptoms I've been experiencing lately. I'm not sure what's going on, and I was hoping you could help me.

Agent 2: Of course, Emily. I'm here to help. Can you please tell me a bit more about the symptoms you're experiencing?

Customer: Well, I've been having these persistent headaches for the past week. They're not unbearable, but they're definitely worrying me. I also noticed that I've been feeling quite fatigued lately, even after a good night's sleep. And sometimes, I feel a bit nauseous too.

Agent 2: I understand your concern, Emily. Headaches, fatigue, and nausea can be caused by various factors. Have you experienced any other symptoms or changes in your health recently?
