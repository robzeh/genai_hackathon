Agent 1: Thank you for calling HealthHarbor, my name is Agent 1. How may I assist you today?

Customer: Hi, I'm calling because I've been experiencing some unusual symptoms lately and I'm not sure what to do about it.

Agent 1: I'm sorry to hear that. Could you please describe your symptoms in detail?

Customer: Sure. I've been having persistent headaches and occasional dizziness. Sometimes, I also feel nauseous.

Agent 1: I understand. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?

Customer: It's been going on for about a week now. At first, I thought it was just stress, but it hasn't gone away.

Agent 1: I see. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that might be causing these symptoms?

Customer: Not really. It's been happening both at home and at work, so I can't pinpoint any specific triggers.

Agent 1: Alright. Based on what you've described, it would be best for you to consult a medical professional. I can help you find a nearby healthcare facility or schedule an appointment for you. 

Customer: That would be great, thank you.

Customer: I'm not familiar with either of them. Which one would you recommend?
