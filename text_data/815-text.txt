Agent 3: Thank you for calling HealthHarbor. My name is Agent 3. How can I assist you today?

Customer: Hi, Agent 3. My name is Anna Johnson. I'm feeling really worried about my health and I was hoping you could help me.

Agent 3: Of course, Anna. I'm here to help. What seems to be the issue?

Customer: Well, I've been experiencing some persistent chest pain lately, and it's really concerning me. I think I need to see a specialist, but I'm not sure where to start.

Agent 3: I understand your concern, Anna. Chest pain is definitely something that should be taken seriously. Have you seen a primary care physician yet?
