Agent 1: Thank you, Mr. Smith. Now, which specialist are you looking to see?

Customer: I need to see a cardiologist. I've been experiencing some chest pain lately, and I want to get it checked out.

Agent 1: I'm sorry to hear that. We definitely want to make sure you receive the necessary care. Are you currently a patient at HealthHarbor?

Agent 1: Great! I have scheduled your appointment with Dr. Johnson on Monday, October 5th, at 2:00 PM. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
