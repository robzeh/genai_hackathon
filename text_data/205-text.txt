Agent 4: Thank you for calling HealthHarbor, my name is Agent 4. How can I assist you today?

Customer: Oh finally! I've been trying to get through to someone for ages! I need to refill my medication, but my pharmacy is saying they need authorization from the doctor. Can you help me with that?

Agent 4: I'm sorry for the wait, and I understand your frustration. I'll do my best to assist you. May I have your name and date of birth, please?

Customer: My name is Sarah Johnson, and my date of birth is January 15, 1980.

Agent 4: I completely understand, Sarah. I assure you that I will do my best to expedite this process for you. I'll make sure to update your doctor's office about the urgency of your situation. Is there anything else I can assist you with while we resolve this issue?
