Customer: Yes, please. I'm not familiar with the procedure.

Agent 3: Not a problem, Sarah. I can help you with that. Firstly, you'll need to provide a written request stating your name, date of birth, the dates of treatment you mentioned earlier, and the specific records you need. You can either mail the request or drop it off in person at our hospital's medical records department.

Agent 3: Yes, there is a nominal fee for processing medical records requests. The fee covers the cost of retrieving, copying, and mailing the records. However, please note that fees may vary depending on the volume of records requested. To get an accurate estimate, I recommend contacting our medical records department directly.

Customer: I understand. I will contact them to get the exact fee. How long does it usually take to process the request once I submit it?
