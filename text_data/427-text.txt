Agent 3: I've found your account, Emily. It seems that your insurance did cover a portion of the procedure, but there is a remaining balance of $200. Would you like to know the payment options available?

Customer: Yes, please. What are my options for paying the remaining balance?

Agent 3: You can make the payment online through our secure portal, or you can also mail a check to our billing department. We also accept payments over the phone if that's more convenient for you.

Customer: Great, I'll do that. Thank you for your assistance, Agent 3. Is there anything else I need to know about my bill or insurance coverage?

Agent 3: You're welcome, Emily. Regarding your insurance coverage, I would recommend contacting your insurance provider directly to confirm the details of your policy and coverage. They will be able to provide you with more specific information.
