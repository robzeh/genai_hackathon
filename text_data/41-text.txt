Agent 4: Thank you for calling HealthHarbor. My name is Agent 4. How may I assist you today?

Customer: Hi Agent 4, my name is Sarah Anderson. I recently had a procedure done at your hospital and I have a few questions regarding my follow-up care.

Agent 4: Hi Sarah, I'm glad you called. I'll be happy to help you with any questions you have about your follow-up care. How can I assist you?

Customer: Well, I had a surgery last week and I'm not sure what I should be doing in terms of my post-operative care. Can you provide me with some guidance?

Agent 4: Of course, Sarah. I can definitely assist you with that. First, may I know which surgery you had?

Customer: I had a knee replacement surgery.

Agent 4: Thank you for sharing that, Sarah. After a knee replacement surgery, it's important to follow certain guidelines for a smooth recovery. Have you been attending physical therapy sessions?

Customer: Yes, I have been going to physical therapy twice a week. But I'm not sure if I'm doing the right exercises at home.

Agent 4: It's great that you're attending physical therapy sessions. Your therapist will guide you with specific exercises to strengthen your knee. Additionally, I can provide you with some general exercises that you can do at home to aid in your recovery. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, that would be great. I want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to recover properly.

Agent 4: Absolutely, Sarah. I will email you a document with a list of exercises that you can perform at home. It's important to do them as instructed by your physical therapist and not push yourself too hard. Gradual progress is key.

Customer: Thank you so much, Agent 4. That will be really helpful. I also have some concerns about the incision site. It seems to be red and slightly swollen. Should I be worried?

Agent 4: Redness and slight swelling around the incision site can be normal during the healing process, Sarah. However, if you notice any signs of infection such as increasing pain, discharge, or fever, it would be best to contact your surgeon immediately.

Customer: Alright, I'll keep an eye out for those symptoms. Thanks for the information. Is there anything else I should be aware of in terms of my recovery?

Agent 4: Yes, Sarah. It's important to follow your surgeon's instructions regarding weight-bearing, medication, and wound care. Make sure to attend all follow-up appointments and communicate any concerns you may have with your healthcare team.

Customer: I will definitely do that. Thank you for all your assistance, Agent 4. You've been really helpful.

Agent 4: You're welcome, Sarah. I'm glad I could assist you. If you have any more questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care and have a speedy recovery!

Customer: Thank you, Agent 4. I appreciate your help. Goodbye!
