Agent 3: Hi, Sarah. I'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling well. I'll do my best to help you. Can you please describe the symptoms you've been experiencing?

Customer: Sure, Agent 3. For the past few days, I've been having a persistent headache, dizziness, and occasional nausea. I haven't had any fever or cough though.

Agent 3: I understand, Sarah. Headache, dizziness, and nausea can be caused by various factors. Have you been under any stress or have you made any changes in your daily routine recently?

Customer: Well, I have been feeling a bit stressed at work lately, but nothing out of the ordinary. And no, I haven't made any significant changes to my routine.

Agent 3: Alright, stress can sometimes contribute to these symptoms. However, it's important for us to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Have you had any recent injuries or accidents?

Customer: No, I haven't had any injuries or accidents recently.

Agent 3: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. Considering your symptoms, it's possible that you may be experiencing tension headaches or migraines.

While I do that, I would also recommend keeping a headache diary to track any patterns or triggers that may be causing your symptoms.
