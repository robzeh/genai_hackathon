(Customer waits)

Agent 1: Thank you for waiting, Sarah. I have scheduled an appointment for you with Dr. Smith, a dermatologist, on Friday, October 22nd, at 2:00 PM. Does that work for you?

Customer: Finally, some progress. Yes, that works for me. But I hope this doctor is better than the last one I saw. I didn't find any relief from their treatment.

Agent 1: I understand your concern, Sarah. Rest assured, Dr. Smith is highly recommended by our patients. However, if you're not satisfied with the treatment, we can look into alternative options as well. We want to ensure you receive the best care possible.

Customer: Alright, I'll give Dr. Smith a chance. But if I'm not satisfied, I'll expect you to find me another dermatologist.

Agent 1: Absolutely, Sarah. Your satisfaction is our priority. If you're not satisfied with the treatment, we'll work on finding you another specialist who can address your concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, that's all for now. I hope this appointment goes well. Goodbye.

Agent 1: I understand your concerns, Sarah. Thank you for choosing HealthHarbor, and we'll do our best to ensure a positive experience. If you have any further questions or need assistance in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. Goodbye, and take care. [/INST] Referrals and Specialist Appointments </s>
