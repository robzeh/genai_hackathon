Care Management Agent: Hello, Sarah. My name is Lisa, and I'm a part of the care management team here at HealthHarbor. I understand you have some concerns about your recovery. Let's discuss your symptoms in detail.

Customer: Hi, Lisa. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. As I mentioned earlier, I'm experiencing more pain than I expected, and my incision site looks concerning.

Lisa: I'm sorry to hear that, Sarah. Pain and changes in the incision site can be worrisome. Let's start by discussing your pain level on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst.

Customer: I would rate my pain at around 7 or 8. It's been persistent and doesn't seem to be getting any better with pain medications.

Lisa: I see. Thank you for sharing that information. It's important for us to address your pain adequately. I will consult with your surgeon and discuss your case. In the meantime, I would recommend applying a cold compress to your incision site to help with the swelling. Please avoid any strenuous activities and keep the area clean and dry.

Customer: Okay, I will try that. But what if the pain doesn't subside? I'm really worried that something might be wrong.

Lisa: I understand your concerns, Sarah. If the pain worsens or if you notice any unusual discharge or fever, it's crucial to seek immediate medical attention. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment with your surgeon to discuss your symptoms in detail and determine the next course of action.

Customer: Thank you, Lisa. I appreciate your help and guidance. I'm just scared that something might go wrong with my recovery.

Lisa: I completely understand, Sarah. It's natural to feel scared, but please remember that we are here to support you throughout your recovery journey. Our team will closely monitor your progress and ensure that you receive the necessary care.
